WARNING: This project is very much in a alpha state and likely requires large changes to the SQL before it could work in your specific school environment.

Pre-reqs:
    - Python 3
    - ODBC access to your PowerSchool server, this has to be requested from PowerSchool support if you are cloud hosted
    - cx_Oracle Python module installed and running to connect to PowerSchool's Oracle DB, https://towardsdatascience.com/connecting-python-to-oracle-sql-server-mysql-and-postgresql-ea1e4523b1e9
        - The batch script assumes that you will install it into a VENV, make sure to change the script it for are just installing for the entire system
    - GAM Installed and Authorised for the domain on the machine running this script
    - edit settings-template.py and save as settings.py
    - PowerSchool Database Extension to hold room calendar lookups
        - Required as is, but can be disabled in settings and by editing user_list.sql
        - Input template, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xL5ks42g8nvmmhf2D871w4aQ4M8aUFcXROof82YH1M/edit#gid=0
        - The SQL references U_ROOM_CALENDARS_GOOGLE, but it can be named anything as long as you edi the SQL
    - Edit all of the sql files to fit your requirements
Optional:
    - edit exclusions-template.py and save as exclusions.py to not sync specific classes

Future improvements planned:
    - Change SQL to SQL within a PowerQueries to avoid using cx_Oracle and ODBC access
    - Change GAM to Google API to avoid need to grant all of GAM's permissions and make the project easier to deploy
    - Change SQL to be less school specific
    - Move Calendar Event naming logic outside of the SQL and into a configuration file
    - Performance improvements
